Thanks for your interest in contributing to `ouch`!

Feel free to open an issue anytime you wish to ask a question, suggest a feature, report a bug, etc.

# Requirements

1. Be nice to other people.
2. If editing the Rust source code, remember to run `rustfmt` (otherwise, CI will warn you the code was not properly formatted).

Note: we are using `unstable` features of `rustfmt`! Nightly toolchain is required (will likely be installed automatically, cause the toolchain was specified in the project root).

# Suggestions

1. If you wish to, you can ask for some guidance before solving an issue.
2. Run `cargo clippy` too.
